The writing style of this was more direct than I'm used to. I haven't read much Japanese literature, so I'm not sure how much of that was the writing style versus the fact that it was translated into English from the original Japanese.

Either way, this was a fun, quick read. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the relationships between the characters. It definitely made me want to plan a trip to Jimbocho, even though I'm sure it's been romanticized a bit for this book.
