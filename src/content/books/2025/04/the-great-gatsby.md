This was a wild thing to read in the current climate. I've read _Gatsby_ a few times and I'm always amazed at how relevant it feels. We all know people like Tom & Daisy (especially these days) and we all know people like Gatsby, stuck in the past, trying to recapture something forever lost. If you haven't read this in a while, or you only read it because someone at some school told you to, it's worth revisiting. A great novel.
