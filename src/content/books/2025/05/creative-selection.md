I enjoyed this! I think parts of it are a little verbose, but getting a sense of how teams at Apple actually worked in the era leading up to the iPhone (maybe they still work that way?) was fascinating. A big takeaway for me is the importance of demos for software. You can't hide behind hand-waving when you're forced to demo something. Everything has to work (or at least appear to work) and people are giving feedback on the literal thing in front of them rather than their imagined idea of what the thing might be based on some flowery description. That's huge. I'm going to attempt to bring some of that into my software work.
