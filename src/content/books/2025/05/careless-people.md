I was less surprised by some of these stories than I expected to be. Maybe that's a symptom of working in "big tech" in the past, or maybe I've just followed Facebook more closely than I thought. I've always kind of assumed the people at the top of that company are clueless about how their decisions impact others and, yep, turns out that's true. I think there'd be more shock value for people who haven't been exposed to "Big Tech" company up close. For me it felt a lot like "well of course that's how they handled this situation because that's what Big Tech would do." Still, generally recommend it if it seems interesting to you.
