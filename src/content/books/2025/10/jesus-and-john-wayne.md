For some reason I didn't expect this to be a straight history book despite everything about it saying that it's a straight history book. Because of my mismatched expectations, it took me a while to get into this, but I'm glad I continued reading it. I went from "how in the world do evangelicals support Trump?" to "oh of course they would support Trump" by the end, so I'd say the author's argument was effective. 😅
