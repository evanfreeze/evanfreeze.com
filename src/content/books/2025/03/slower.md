I really liked [In Praise of Slowness](/books/2024/07/in-praise-of-slowness), so reading Honoré share a more practical take on how to implement some of his ideas seemed intriguing. I think this is mostly 50 blog posts stitched together and called a book. It's has some intersting ideas worth trying out, but I preferred the other one.
