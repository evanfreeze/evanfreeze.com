I absolutely loved this. Listening to the audiobook read by Meryl Streep was incredible and I highly recommend experiencing this story that way. The book was somehow atmospheric without having atmospheric language — I was transported to this world and was living alongside these characters. They were so real. Huge fan, five stars, definitely read this.
