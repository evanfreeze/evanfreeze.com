This was a journey. It took me a year-and-a-half of off-and-on reading to get through this, but it was worth it. It's still somewhat fresh in my mind, but this feels like one of those books that changes how I see the world. Incredibly well researched and written.

That said, it's hard to recommend it because of the length. 1,200 pages or 67 hours of audiobook is a lot for anyone. I think it's worth the effort, but I wouldn't fault anyone who skips it 😅
