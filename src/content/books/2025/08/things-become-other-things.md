I've been reading Craig's writing on his [website](https://craigmod.com) and his [newsletters](https://craigmod.com/newsletters/) for years, so it was fun to dive into something longer from him. I loved this. It's thoughtful, sharp, witty, an all around great read. It's hard not to think about the current political landscape in America as a by-product of the kind of town death he writes about. I loved the framing of writing to Bryan. Highly recommend this one.
