This was a lighthearted read. It doesn't have a plot (other than the author learning more about birds and getting better at drawing them), but I think it still works despite that.

Each entry is a day in the life Tan watching birds out her window. Entries sometimes reference previous days, but most of the time they're a one-off tales of what the birds did that day. The illustrations are gorgeous.

I don't think you should read this like a novel. The strucutre lends itself better to dipping in for a few entries every couple of days, then carrying on with something else.
