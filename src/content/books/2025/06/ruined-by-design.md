I loved this. It's a searing take on so many of the ills of the modern tech and a reminder that everything the industry has brought into the world was designed—intentionally or not—by someone.

I left this feeling empowered to stand up to unethical uses of technology and to advocate for protecting people when making product decisions. Those were stances I already held, but this gave me encouragement to fight even harder.
