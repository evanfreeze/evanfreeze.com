This is immediately one of my new favorite "productivity" books (if you can call it that, since it's somewhat anti-"productivity" in the "bro" sense of it). It suggests reading it one day at a time over the course of four weeks rather than just sitting down and plowing through it. I followed that plan (with a break in the middle) and found it incredibly helpful in allowing the ideas to burrow into my mind and actually take root. It's too easy with "self help" to read it, find it interesting, and then totally forget it once you're done. That hasn't happened with this and I think the novel structure is the reason for it. Highly recommend this one if it sounds at all interesting.
