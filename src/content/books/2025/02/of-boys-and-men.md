Reading this is a bit like seeing "the matrix" of the last 5-10 years. Reeves has some compelling ideas for how we can improve the crisis we're seeing with men who've lost their way.

I struggled a bit toward the end once Reeves shifted away from "here's what the problem is and the data to back it up" into "here's what we can do" mode because most of the issues require structural change to solve. I don't really have the power to change structural, society-level policy, so it felt a little pie-in-the-sky for me.
