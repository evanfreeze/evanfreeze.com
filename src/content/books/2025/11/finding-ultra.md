My first encounter with Rich Roll was listening to Craig Mod's appearance on his podcast ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfiUXiTg5z4&pp=ygUTcmljaCByb2xsIGNyYWlnIG1vZA%3D%3D)) and I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and considered questions. I decided to grab this from the library and I enjoyed learning more about his past and his lifestyle.
