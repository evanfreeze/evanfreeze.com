I had a blast with this. I don't think I liked it as much as [_Babel_](/book-log/2025/05/babel), maybe roughly the same as [_Yellowface_](/book-log/2024/10/yellowface), but I feel like I won't turn down a new R.F. Kuang novel at this point. Maybe I'll go back and read The Poppy War trilogy at some point.
