I liked this, but didn't love it. I'm fairly immersed in the tech world, so none of this was eye-opening or surprising to me, but it was nice to have it all bundled together. 

My issues with the book are issues with Doctorow's general writing style: he tends to ascribe ill-intent to things that could be equally explained by a lack of consideration for consequences. I think tech tends to operate more in the latter, less in the former.
