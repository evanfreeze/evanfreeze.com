Jas and I have been listening to Meryl Streep read [Tom Lake](/book-log/2025/03/tom-lake) while we fall asleep. _Our Town_ plays a significant role in that book and I realized I don't think I'd read it since middle or high school – I can't remember. 

Anyway, it's great! It's incredible straightforward and simple (but not simplistic) in a way that makes its message hit even harder. I wouldn't call it a fun read, but one of the great American plays.
