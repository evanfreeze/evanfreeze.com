This book was in our hotel room in Carmel, Indiana when we visited. I debated whether to include it here, but it is a book I read, so here it is. I was officially the first person to give it a rating on GoodReads (which I'm still trying to get off of), which is fun trivia.

What Brainard did in Carmel reminds me a lot of [Strong Towns](/book-log/2024/09/strong-towns). Being in Carmel felt comfortable in a way I haven't experienced in an American suburb. Kudos to them for actually doing good things for the people who live there.
