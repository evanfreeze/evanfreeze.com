I probably annoyed my teammates by not shutting up about this book. Anyone who writes code should read this. It inspired me to refactor almost all of [oscarpicks.net](https://www.oscarpicks.net) and I love where the code ended up. I had a few feature ideas I'd been wanting to build, but they felt too complicated so I pushed them off. Now they'd be trivially easy to add, so that's a win to me.
