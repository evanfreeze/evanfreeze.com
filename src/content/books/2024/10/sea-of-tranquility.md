This one took me by surprise in a great way. I'd had it on my list since around the time it was published; I think maybe John Green recommended it in a video or something. I read it over the course of maybe 12 hours with a sleep in the middle and loved it. A sci-fi romp that made me think about the power simple acts of kindness can have to change the world.
