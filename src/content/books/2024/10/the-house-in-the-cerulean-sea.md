This was a fun read. I enjoyed the characters and their interactions and just the overall vibe. I wanted to hang out with them and go on adventures. I thought it was a little heavy-handed with its messaging in places. Specifically some of the dialogue given to the kids seemed a bit trite and not quite in the voice that the character would have in other scenes.

Read a tiny bit about how this was maybe loosely inspired by the [Sixties Scoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixties_Scoop) period of time in Canada, which I'd never even heard of and is...incomprehensible. There are a few GoodReads reviews tearing into the book because of thatâ€”saying that it profited off that story. I don't really have an opinion or want to weigh in there, but seeing that criticism has made the satire of [Yellowface](/book-log/2024/10/yellowface) all the more biting.
