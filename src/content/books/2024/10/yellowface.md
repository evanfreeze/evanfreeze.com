Wow, what a ride! I stayed up late finishing this because I couldn't put it down. I'm not familiar with the inner-workings of the publishing industry, so Iâ€™m not sure where the line is between satire and this-is-actually-real-but-no-one-will-admit-it, but it feels like this book walks it perfectly. An absolute blast to read.
