Picked this one up for the [Christy Anne Jones Patreon book club](https://www.patreon.com/c/christyannejones/) and read it in literally twenty minutes. A fun, whimsical, parable/fairy-tale-style short story with some beautiful illustrations.

This had a great winter vibe that feels like a good way to usher in the season.
