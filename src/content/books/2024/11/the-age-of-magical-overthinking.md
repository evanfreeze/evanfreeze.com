I didn't intentionally choose to read this during the 2024 election season, but wow did that turn out to be an interesting decision.

Many of the biases discussed here are everywhere in American lifeâ€”maybe even just "human life" as we all become more connected through the internet.

Each chapter tackles a different bias, so it gives you natural break points to methodically read through it. I enjoyed the author's voice and relatabbility.

This is definitely a useful book for the current moment.
