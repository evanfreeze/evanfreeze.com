Another read-it-in-one-sitting tome about life from [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs). I've read all of his now, except maybe _Your Music and People_, and they're always thought provoking.

No different here, I found his framing of what is "true" to be somewhat extreme, but a useful lens through which to view the world and how people behave in it.

I didn't intend this, but it paired nicely with [The Age of Magical Overthinking](/book-log/2024/11/the-age-of-magical-overthinking), which I finished right before starting it.

If you like Derek's other books, you'll probably like this one. I'd say it compares most closely to _How to Live_.
