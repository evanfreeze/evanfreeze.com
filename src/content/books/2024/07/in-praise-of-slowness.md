I think I heard about this from Cal Newport, either in [Slow Productivity](https://bookshop.org/p/books/slow-productivity-the-lost-art-of-accomplishment-without-burnout-cal-newport/20143790?ean=9780593544853) or his podcast, and I picked it up digitally from the library. I don't know that it's a mind-blowing read or super well written, but I really like the concept of slowing down and applying the "slow food" mentality to other areas of life. The section about slowing down while driving was especially interesting to me — it pairs nicely with [Traffic](/book-log/2024/10/traffic/) by Tom Vanderbilt.

Some of the sections feel a bit dated since this was written in 2005 — the author makes some predictions that definitely didn't pan out — but I think the overall concept still holds up and is worth pondering further.
