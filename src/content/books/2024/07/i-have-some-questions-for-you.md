Oh wow, really liked this one. There's dark-academia-The-Secret-History vibes in spades, but a more modern take. This has some interesting things to say about cancel culture and the nature of the media these days, along with an examination of privilege in academia and how that favors certain folks and works against others. The writing is fantastic and I got completely swept up in the story.
