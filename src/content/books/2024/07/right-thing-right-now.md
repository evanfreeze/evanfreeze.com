Ryan Holiday's virtues series continues with a book about Justice. This one feels especially relevant in 2024 â€” I wish people in power would read this. The idea of justice and "doing the right thing" has been somewhat of an innate human virtue for centuries, yet we too often fall short of this ideal. This is a great read and a powerful reminder of how we should act in the world.
