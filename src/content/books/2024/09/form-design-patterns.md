Adam Silver's stuff is great and so is this book. I found some of the code samples a little outdated and browsers have improved since this was written, so some of the workarounds he mentions are no longer necessary. That said, this book's fundamentals of clear and easy-to-use form design are still rock solid. I strongly recommend it for anyone who builds forms on the web.

Also, check out the [UK digital service's design systems and guidelines](https://design-system.service.gov.uk). Adam worked on these at one point and they're an invaluable resource.
