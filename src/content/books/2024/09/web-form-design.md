I'm not sure if I loved this. It has some great advice about form design, but most of it I'd already read before in [Adam Silver's book](/books/2024/09/form-design-patterns). The examples and screenshots were also pretty dated, which made it harder to parse out what advice is still relevant and what is a by-product of the time when this was written.
