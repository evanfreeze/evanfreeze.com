This was gorgeous. Basically no plot, just vibes and imagery. Usually that doesn't do it for me, but for whatever reason it worked here. The feeling I had reminded me of how I feel hearing John Green talk about sunsets in _The Anthropocene Reviewed_, in a good way. I get why it won the Booker Prize.
