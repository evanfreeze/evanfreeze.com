I've been a fan of _The Nerdwriter_ YouTube series for years and have wanted to read Evan's book since I first heard about it. I have no idea why it took me so long.

I really enjoyed listening to this as an audiobook on a long road trip with my wife. I've gotten used to hearing Evan read his own words from the aforementioned _Nerdwriter_ videos, so it felt natural to hear him narrate this.

I especially loved the essay about what to do when experts disagree. It's a question I've pondered many times myself, so it was nice to hear a fellow Evan also struggle with how to square conflicting guidance from experts.

Overall, I was struck by the introspection and depth of the book. I'm not sure why — he's great at that in his videos — but for some reason I just maybe wasn't expecting it here? Not sure. Anyway, a great read.
