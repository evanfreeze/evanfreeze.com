This was a good overview of fascism from the start of the 20th century through roughly 2017 or so. It didn't get too deep on any one particular country or person, but gave a solid historical look at the who's-who of fascist dictators that I found informative. It's also a solid plea for working to preserve democracy wherever we can, which feels especially relevant in late 2024.
