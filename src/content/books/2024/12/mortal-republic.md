This was a bit of a chore to get through. My level of interest in how the Roman republic fell apart ended up being lower than I thought, so this read a bit like a text book in parts. It was interesting to see how some of the things that happened in Rome centuries ago are repeating themselves in America today, but I would've liked the book to go more into the consequences of certain events rather than just giving me a history. Maybe we're limited by the historical record on this, but there wasn't a ton about how everyday Romans navigated these wild events, which is what I think I was looking for.
