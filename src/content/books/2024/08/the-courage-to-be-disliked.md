This was an odd one. I think the authors have some interesting ideas (or rather, Adlerian psychology has some interesting ideas, since this book is basically just that philosohpy presented in a novel format), but I feel like it was almost too dogmatic in its devotion to its ideas. A controversial take on life, to be sure.
