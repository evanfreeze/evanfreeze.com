I don't know if I liked this one quite as much as _The Maid_ (the first in the series), but overall I still really enjoyed it. I find certain scenes with Molly sometimes difficult to read because of how out of the loop she can sometimes be (I think I get second-hand embarrassment or something), but it's a really fun series nonetheless. This did give me some Knives Out vibes in parts, which is one of my favorite movies.
