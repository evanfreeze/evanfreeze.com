The discussion of this book in [_Wake Up Dead Man_](https://letterboxd.com/film/wake-up-dead-man/) inspired me to pick it up. It's a lot of fun! There are clear parallels between it and the Rian Johnson's latest movie. I especially enjoyed the meta aspects of this, which would be a spoilery to mention. A good time!

P.S. [Apparently this is a called _The Three Coffins_ in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollow_Man_(Carr_novel)#:~:text=The%20Three%20Coffins%20in%20the%20USA) (which I am in), so if you're looking for it, that's it. Same book. I used the other title for this because I like it better.
