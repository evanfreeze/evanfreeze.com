I'm building an iOS app. The code is almost ready to ship, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with everything else needed to actually launch it.

I have a launch page for it (check it out and join the beta at [readrate.app](https://www.readrate.app)), but I want to add FAQs, screenshots, and some basic press materials.

I don't consider myself a professional iOS developer, but the idea of being an independent iOS developer has always fascinated me. I took a swing at it around 2015, but I didn't have the skills to make it work at the time.

Maybe I still don't, but at least I have a (to me) good idea and a working app this time.

Hopefully, it'll launch soon.
