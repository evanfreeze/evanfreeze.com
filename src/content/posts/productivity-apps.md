I'm not sure why productivity apps have such a grip on me. I love trying them and comparing their features. Sometimes I'll spend more time messing with a new productivity app than I actually spend working. This isn't ideal or healthy, but here I am.

The thing is, I feel like the next app I try is going to be "the one" that makes everything click. Suddenly I'll become a productive zen master who never procrastinates and is always on top of everything. I know this is silly, but it's romantic to think finding the right app — something comparatively easy and painless — can be what makes the difference. You know, instead of doing the actual work.

The app doesn't matter, the work matters.

Do the work. Use whatever app you want.

Oh wait, this one looks cool.
