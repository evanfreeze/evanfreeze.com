ClichÃ©d? Totally.

Did I do it anyway? Absolutely.

You're reading this on an Astro re-write of my site. It used to be a Next.js site before the whole app directory / server-component holy wars began.

I decided rather than weigh in on that, I'd rather just use something simpler for my needs. This site is very simple. It could honestly just be html files on a server that I manually update, but I wasn't ready to go that far.

Anyway, here it is. I'm hoping this technical revamp will get me to actually write more here, but that's never worked for me in the past.

Oh yeah, there's an RSS feed now too! Thanks for making that easy, Astro team ðŸš€

Hope everyone's new year is off to a great start!
