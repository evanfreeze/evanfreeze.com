So I built a web version of my forever-still-in-beta iOS app, [Read Rate](https://www.readrate.app), using [Remix](https://remix.run/) over the weekend.

It was great.

Remix is leveraging the actual web platform to make simple what is usually tedious to do in React (forms with complex validation and good accessibility, oof).

As I was working through the [Remix Jokes guided project](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes) and building my own Read Rate web app, I was actually having fun doing form validation — yes, really!

If you do any frontend work, you owe it to yourself to give Remix a try and see what they're doing. It feels like a throwback to a simpler time in web development while also keeping all the good stuff we've come to love about the modern frontend landscape.
