title: New "Book Log" Section
description: Because I wanted a place to log my reading away from Daddy Bezos.

I added a new section to the site for tracking the books I read â€” it's called [Book Log](/book-log).

My goal with this was to create a place where I could log my reading that's fully in my control. GoodReads works, but I don't love it's association with Amazon. Plus their UI is kind of wild and hasn't materially improved in...like a decade, maybe?

I'm also slightly bitter about them [cutting off API access for new apps](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Why-is-Goodreads-limiting-API-usage), since I make [an app that helps you track your reading](https://www.readrate.app). It would definitely benefit from the GoodReads API if it was possible for me to actually use it.

Anyway, I added the last few months of books to the new Book Log and I hope to get the rest of 2024 up soon. Maybe I'll even go back to previous years if I'm feeling motivated.

Happy reading!
