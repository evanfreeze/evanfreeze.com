  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Oh hey 👋🏻</p>
  <p>
    I'm a Software Engineer based in Nashville, TN. By day, I do frontend work
    for{" "}
    <a href="https://joinforage.com">Forage</a> to help enable EBT & SNAP benefits
    through online merchants. Previously, I built web apps for the Support team at
    <a href="https://www.lyft.com">Lyft</a>, led development for the video
    Travel Course platform <a href="https://www.brighttrip.com">Bright Trip</a>,
    and built some cool stuff at <a href="https://www.marmalade.co">Marmalade</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the stuff I build is with a combination of React, TypeScript,
    Node.js, with various meta-framework flavors on top of that. I'm also
    dabbling in iOS development, but it's a work in progress.
